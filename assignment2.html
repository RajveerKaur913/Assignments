            clothes.length = 0;
            console.log(clothes[0])


            // OUTPUT: undefined
            // (Because we give the array length value 0 so that means our array have 0 length n nothing store between array thats why output is undefined)



// Question 2
// Write a Javascript program to find the sum of all elements of a given array?

            var arr=[10,35,78,25,49,60]

            }
            console.log(sum);
